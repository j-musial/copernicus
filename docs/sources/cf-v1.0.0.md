# Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions (v1.0.0)

- **Source repository:** [stac-extensions/cf](https://github.com/stac-extensions/cf)
- **Upstream version:** v1.0.0
- **Upstream schema:** <https://stac-extensions.github.io/cf/v1.0.0/schema.json#>
- **License:** Apache-2.0

The following is the specification text of the *Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions* extension as merged into
the Copernicus STAC Extension. All field names below use the `copernicus:` prefix.

---

- **Title:** CF
- **Identifier:** <https://stac-extensions.github.io/cf/v1.0.0/schema.json>
- **Field Name Prefix:** cf
- **Scope:** Item, Collection
- **Extension [Maturity Classification](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/master/extensions/README.md#extension-maturity):** Proposal
- **Owner**: @Fred-Leclercq

This document explains the CF Extension to the [SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec) (STAC) specification.

It adds fields to provide the properties that mirror the [CF metadata convention](http://cfconventions.org/).

- Examples:
  - [Item](https://github.com/stac-extensions/cf/blob/main/examples/item.json) and [Collection](https://github.com/stac-extensions/cf/blob/main/examples/collection.json):
    Shows the basic usage of the extension in a STAC Item and a corresponding summarizing STAC Collection
- [JSON Schema](https://github.com/stac-extensions/cf/blob/main/json-schema/schema.json)
- [Changelog](https://github.com/stac-extensions/cf/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

### Fields

The fields in the table below can be used in these parts of STAC documents:

- [ ] Catalogs
- [x] Collections
- [x] Item Properties (incl. Summaries in Collections)
- [x] Assets (for both Collections and Items, incl. Item Asset Definitions in Collections and Asset Templates)
- [ ] Links (incl. Link Templates)
- [x] Bands
- [x] Data Cube Extension (`copernicus:variables`, `copernicus:dimensions`)

| Field Name       | Type      | Description |
| ---------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| copernicus:standard_name | string    | Corresponds to the [CF Standard Name](https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html). |
| copernicus:cell_methods  | \[string\|null] | A list of string or `null` attributes that describe the "method" applied to the data as defined in the CF conventions. |
| description      | string    | Corresponds to the [CF `long_name`](https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#long-name). |
| unit             | string    | Corresponds to the [CF `units`](https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#units). |

#### Additional Field Information

##### copernicus:standard_name

The CF standard name is a controlled vocabulary term used in Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata conventions
to unambiguously describe the physical quantity represented by a variable in climate and geophysical data files.
If variable has a standard_name definition in the CF convention, it must be a non-empty value from the
[CF Standard Name Table](https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html).
Otherwise `copernicus:standard_name` is an empty value.

##### copernicus:cell_methods

The cell_methods attribute in the CF (Climate and Forecast) convention is designed to describe how the values in a data variable
were derived with respect to one or more axes (e.g., time, latitude, longitude). Each "method" represents the statistical or
computational operations applied to data along specific axes. For example, if used within the datacube extension then the
order of cell_methods aligns with the order of spatial and temporal extensions.

```json
"copernicus:variables": {
  "some_variable": {
    "copernicus:cell_methods": [null, "minimum"],
    "dimensions": [
        "vertical_dimension1",
        "time_interval2"
    ]
  }
}
```

In this case `null` indicates that no method is applied over the first dimension `vertical_dimension1` but
the `minimum` method is applied over the second dimension `time_interval2`. 
These dimensions would be defined in the `copernicus:dimensions` fields.

If a data value is representative of variation over a combination of axes this approach is not sufficient \(e.g. the standard
deviation of topographic height within a longitude-latitude gridbox would have `cell_methods="latitude: longitude: standard_deviation"`\).
Such `cell_methods` cannot be described as per dimension methods in an array and would need a plain string representation.

```json
"copernicus:variables": {
  "some_variable": {
    "copernicus:cell_methods": "latitude: longitude: standard_deviation",
    "dimensions": [
        "latitude",
        "longitude"
    ]
  }
}
```

See [CF Cell Methods](https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#cell-methods) for more details.

##### description

The description field as defined by the [NUG](https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/nug/current/index.html) is meant to contain a long descriptive
name which may, for example, be used for labeling plots. 
See [CF "long_name"](https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#long-name) for more details.

##### unit

The unit of measurement for the values, preferably compliant to [UCUM](https://ucum.org/[) (unit code)
or [UDUNITS-2](https://ncics.org/portfolio/other-resources/udunits2/) (unit symbol or alternatively singular unit name).
Unit is not required for dimensionless quantities. A variable with no unit attribute is assumed to be
dimensionless. The conforming unit for quantities that represent fractions, or parts of a whole, is "1".
Descriptive information about dimensionless quantities, such as sea-ice concentration, cloud fraction,
probability, etc., should be given in the "description" attribute rather than the unit field.
See [CF "units"](https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#dimensionless-units) for more details.
